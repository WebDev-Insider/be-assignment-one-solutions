# Version Control

**1. Why is version control important in software development?**

✅ Tracks Changes: See who changed what and when.

✅ Team Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project safely.

✅ Reverts Mistakes: Go back to earlier versions if something breaks.

✅ Experiment Safely: Try new features in branches without affecting the main code.

**2. How does version control help in team collaboration?**

Everyone works on their own branch — no code clashes.

Tracks who made what changes — easy to review or undo.

Merges everyone’s work smoothly into one main project.

Avoids overwriting each other’s code — safer teamwork.

**3. What are the best practices for organizing a Git repository?**

Use a clear folder structure
→ Keep code, tests, docs, and configs in separate folders.

Write good commit messages
→ Make them short, clear, and meaningful.

Use branches wisely
→ main for stable code, feature branches for new work.

.gitignore important files
→ Ignore node_modules, secrets, and build files.

Tag releases
→ Use Git tags like v1.0 to mark versions.

Keep the repo clean
→ Remove unused files and old branches.
