# Combined Concepts

**1. How would you explain the relationship between Node.js and version control in a development workflow?**

Node.js is the runtime you use to build apps (like APIs, websites, tools).

Version control (like Git) is how you track and manage changes to your Node.js code.

**2. What are the key considerations when setting up a new Node.js project with version control?**

$$
Initialize Git
$$

git init

$$
Create a .gitignore file
$$

Ignore node_modules/, .env, and build files to keep your repo clean.

$$
Use package.json
$$

Run npm init -y to manage dependencies and scripts.

$$
Write Clear Commit Messages
$$

Helps track changes and understand project history.

$$
Set Up Branching
$$

Use branches for features, fixes, or testing (e.g., main, dev, feature/signup).

$$
Push to a Remote Repo
$$

Use GitHub, GitLab, etc., to back up your project and collaborate.

**3. How can version control help in managing Node.js dependencies?**

$$
Tracks package.json and package-lock.json
$$

→ Keeps a record of which packages and versions your project uses.

$$
Ensures consistency
$$

→ Everyone on the team installs the same dependencies, avoiding "it works on my machine" issues.

$$
Easily rollback
$$

→ If a package update breaks something, you can revert to a previous working version.

$$
Collaboration-friendly
$$

→ Others can clone the repo, run npm install, and get the exact setup you had.
