# Advanced Git Operations

**1. When and how would you use Git stash?**

Use git stash when you need to switch branches or pull updates but you don’t want to commit your current work yet.

It’s like temporarily packing your work into a suitcase so you can come back to it later.

Stash your changes
Switch branches or do other work.
Bring your changes back

**2 Explain the purpose of Git tags and how to create them?**

Git tags are used to mark specific points in your project’s history — usually for releases (like v1.0, v2.0).

They help identify versions of your code, so you can easily refer back to them.

Create a lightweight tag (just a label)
Or, create an annotated tag (with message)
Push the tag to GitHub

Use Tags When:
Releasing a new version

Marking stable points in the project

Keeping track of major changes

**2. How do you manage remote repositories in Git?**

Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted online (like GitHub). You use them to collaborate and share code.

Add a remote
See current remotes
Push to remote
Pull from remote
Rename a remote
Remove a remote
