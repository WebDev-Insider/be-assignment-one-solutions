# Collaborative Workflow

**1. Explain the purpose and process of creating a pull request.**

A pull request lets you ask to merge your code into another branch (usually main). It’s like saying, “Hey, I made changes — can someone review and add them?”

- How to Do It:

Push your branch to GitHub

Click “New Pull Request”

Add a title & description

Submit it!

**2. What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?**

- Forking:
  Makes a copy of someone else’s repo under your GitHub account.
  Used when you want to contribute to a project you don’t own.

- Cloning:
  Makes a local copy of a repo on your computer.
  Used when you want to work on any repo offline.

**3. How would you use Git to collaborate with other developers on the same project?**

Clone the project to your computer
Create a new branch for your work
Make changes, then commit them
Push your branch to GitHub
Create a pull request so others can review and merge your changes
Pull updates regularly to stay in sync
